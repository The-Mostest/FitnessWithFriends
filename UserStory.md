# User Story: **Mobile Fitness App**

## Summary:
This mobile-based fitness app allows users to log their workouts and engage with their training partners by commenting on each other's exercises, fostering a supportive, social fitness community.

## As a user:
- **Landing Page:**  
  When I open the app, I will be greeted with a landing page that contains:
    - An overview of the app and its features.
    - User experiences and testimonials.
    - A prominent **LOG IN** button for access.

- **Login Process:**  
  Upon clicking the **LOG IN** button, I will be directed to a login form with the following fields:
    - Username
    - Password
    - Group Name (representing my training group)  
  I will log into my account and my 'group', which is a family-style system connecting me with my training partners. This system allows me to view my workouts as well as those of my group members. I can comment on their workouts, but I cannot modify any workout that isn’t my own.

## Features:

- **Post-Login Navigation:**
  After logging in, I will be presented with two main navigation buttons:
    1. **Fitness Logger**: To log my exercises, sets, reps, and weights.
    2. **Friends' Training Page**: To view and comment on my training partners’ workouts.

- **Fitness Logger:**
  When I navigate to the **Fitness Logger** page, I will see a card-based layout. Each exercise I log will be represented as a ‘card’. For each exercise:
    - I can add the exercise name as a header.
    - I will be able to log the number of sets, reps, load lifted, and include optional notes for each set.
    - Each exercise is recorded in a table format with each row representing one set.
    - There will be a **+** button to add more rows as needed for additional sets.
    - An optional **Cardio** section will allow me to log cardio exercises with a time field and additional rows for extended entries.
    - Once I finish logging an exercise, I can return to the workout homepage to log another exercise by adding a new card.

- **Workout Summary & Save:**  
  At the bottom of the Fitness Logger page, I will have the option to add general workout notes. Upon clicking the **Save** button:
    - My workout, including all exercises and logged data, will be saved and pushed to the **Friends' Training Page**.

- **Friends' Training Page (Social Feature):**
  This page is designed like a social media feed where:
    - Workouts saved by my training partners are displayed in a feed-like format.
    - Each workout will be shown in its own box, labelled with the user who posted it and containing all relevant workout data.
    - I can add supportive comments under each workout. Comments will include timestamps, my username, and the content of my message.
    - All workouts and comments are displayed in a scrollable column layout, making it easy to browse and engage with my group’s activity.

## Key Functionality:
- Users can log their own workouts and view their training partners’ progress without altering anyone else’s entries.
- The app integrates social elements by allowing users to comment on each other's workouts, encouraging support and accountability within the group.
- The interface is card-based and user-friendly, with separate sections for strength exercises and cardio.
